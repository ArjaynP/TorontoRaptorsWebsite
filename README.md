# TorontoRaptorsWebsite
  Created a Toronto Raptors Website in one of my computer science courses. There are five different pages, and the programming language that I used is html. I also used affinity photo to create and design some of the images such as the banner, buttons, players, the background, as well as other images. There is also a video that edited using iMovie.
